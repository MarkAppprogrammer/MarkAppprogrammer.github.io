You've probably seen a convolution before, whether you know it or not. And they're super useful in deep learning.

# $$\text{Convoluti}\!\ast \!\text{ns}$$

*Work in Progress below*

Let's say we have two polynomials $$P(x)$$ and $$Q(x)$$ what is their product. Now you may recall the FOIL or BOX method from gradeschool.

Before I explain why polynomial multiplication is a sort of convolution I will first define a discrete convolution.

$$(f \ast g)(s) := \sum_{x=-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) g(s - x)$$

(*Note: $$ := $$ is read "defined as"*). While the summation may look scary it simply means that were summing over one function and the shifted values of another function

The formula for a convolution is the following

$$(f \ast g)(s) := \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) g(s - x) dx$$

where $$\ast$$ means to convolve, $$f(x)$$ is the kernel and $$g(x)$$ is the function to be convolved.
