You've probably seen a convolution before, whether you know it or not. And they're super useful in DL.

# $$\text{Convoluti}\ast \text{ns}$$

*Work in Progress below*

Multiplying polynomials example here.

The formula for a convolution is the following

$$(f \ast g)(s) := \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) g(s - x) dx$$

where $$\ast$$ means to convolve, $$f(x)$$ is the kernel and $$g(x)$$ is the function to be colvolved.
